This project demonstrates how to create a Python-based AI chatbot using the Llama 3 model, running entirely on your local machine for enhanced privacy and control. By leveraging the Ollama tool to download and manage the model locally and the LangChain library for building prompt templates and conversation chains, this chatbot can engage in contextual conversations with memory retention. The guide includes step-by-step instructions for setting up the environment, downloading the model, and writing a Python script to interact with it, making it a perfect starting point for AI enthusiasts who value customization and data privacy. 🚀
